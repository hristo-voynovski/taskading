## Fixes and improvements

-- task.status is obsolete in db. Check if it's use can be dropped and whether columnid where title is for example "todo" can be used

-- Refactor code so rerenders don't trigger so many action repetitions (i.e. calling useBoard)


# Bugs progress 

~~column.id is not being set properly because the status property of a task has been removed~~

## Plans

[] Login and Sign up page
[] Make menu for changing boards 
[] Add option to give access to other users to a board.
[] Add side panel menu for all options (night mode, changing board, inviting users)
[] Add the option to delete tasks
[] Full screen view of task
